# Schantz' New Year's Coding Challenge 2017
This repo contains code related to [Schantz' New Year's Coding Challenge 2017](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/schantz-new-years-coding-challenge-2017-espen-højsgaard) on LinkedIn.


# Evaluation of solutions
To make scoring manageable, a script will be used to score submissions. We will up use the same Python3 script ([definitive_size.py](./definitive_size.py)) as last year. The script is a slight modification of a script kindly provided by Christian Iversen – thanks for letting us use it!

The Python3 script [compare.py](./compare.py) will be used to verify that the output produced by the submitted solutions matches the reference output [Santas-pension-projection.txt](./Santas-pension-projection.txt).


# Results

# Prize ceremony
Friday 10 February we had a little prize ceremony at Schantz, where the winner of both categories, Christian Iversen, visited Schantz to receive his prizes.

Christian gave an entertaining presentation of how he had tackled the challenge and arrived at his solutions. Very interesting and fun - thanks Christian!
